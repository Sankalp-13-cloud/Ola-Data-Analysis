# Ola-Data-Analysis
## Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of Ola ride bookings for Bengaluru using MySQL, Power Query, and Power BI. Data was extracted and queried using MySQL Workbench, cleaned and transformed with Power Query, and visualized through a dynamic dashboard in Power BI. The goal was to understand customer behavior, ride efficiency, cancellation patterns, payment preferences, and operational performance during a one-month period involving 100,000+ records.

## Key Insights
1. 62% of bookings were successful, cancellations by drivers and customers stayed within allowed limits.
2. Prime Sedan and Mini were the top vehicle types by ride distance.
3. Ride volume and booking value were highest on weekends and match days.
